# CTorch Library
* Made with C++ and Object Oriented Programming principles
* Fully supported tensor and type classes with automatic memory management
* Implmented both forward and backwards propagation for Module containers and the Linear layer
* Activation functions such as ReLU and Softmax
* Uses RAII principles such as unique pointers and clean memory usage

# Setup
* Write model or test code in main.cc
* In the terminal, run make
* Run the executable (In the terminal, run './ctorch')

# Current working modules
* Datatypes
* Module containers
* Linear layer

# Work in progress
* Convolutional Layers
* Multi-shape Transposition and Summation
* non-Linear Activations
* Normalization
* Pooling Layers
